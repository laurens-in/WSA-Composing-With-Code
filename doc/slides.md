## Composing With Code
Laurens Inauen

---

### Plan
1. Introduction with slides
	1. What is composition?
	3. What are data structures?
	4. What is Typescript?
	5. What could we mean by "composing with code"?
2. Composing with code

---

### What is composition?*

---

The structuring of musical events over time.

---

### How is this achieved?

### Compositional Systems

→ system produces music\
→ desire for new music\
→ new system\
→ rinse, repeat

---
### Compositional Systems

- may express the same things
	- this is the basis of my master thesis
	- as do computational models
	- as do programming languages
- influence the way we compose

---

### Compositional Systems

- Have some way of formalizing/structuring musical events
- Have some way of putting events into relationships

---

### Compositional Systems

how does this relate to code?

---

### Compositional Systems

- We can translate existing systems into code
- We can create **new systems** _using code_

---

### Compositional Systems

If we think of musical events as data, there are already many such formalized structures that exist. We call them _data structures_.
